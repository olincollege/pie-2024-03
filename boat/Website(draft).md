## Evolution of the Code and Circuit Design

### **Circuit Design**
The circuit has always stayed the same since it’s a simple design where we just plug into established circuit elements such as an ESC and a GPS module.

### **Code Evolution**
1. **Initial Logic**:
   - Movement was determined by the boat’s position relative to the final destination.
   - If the boat moved past the destination on either latitude or longitude, it would switch direction (left/right).
   - *Issue*: This caused the boat to take inefficient routes.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - Tracked previous and current coordinates to calculate if the boat was moving closer to the destination along latitude or longitude.
   - Flipped direction if the boat got further away.
   - *Issue*: The boat failed to account for situations where it faced the wrong direction entirely.

3. **Final Iteration**:
   - Calculated the current heading (based on previous and current coordinates) and compared it to the target heading (current to destination coordinates).
   - If the heading deviated beyond 45 degrees, the boat corrected its course.
   - Added logic to switch direction based on proximity to the target.

### **Final Code Design Elements**
- Initial delay to allow user to place the boat in water.
- Saves the start coordinates and calculates waypoints.
- Runs a navigation cycle every 4 seconds:
  1. Adjusts heading if it deviates beyond 45 degrees.
  2. Stops adjusting when close to the target coordinate.
- Switches waypoints within 10 meters and stops motors at the final destination for 30 seconds before returning to the start point.

### **Troubleshooting Errors**
1. **Unreliable GPS Connection**:
   - Solved by soldering wires to stabilize the GPS signal.

2. **Broken Compass**:
   - Adapted navigation logic to use GPS data only by calculating the boat’s heading from current and previous positions.

3. **Overflow Issues**:
   - GPS stopped sending updates when variables were initialized within the main loop.
   - Moved initialization outside the loop to resolve this.

4. **Drift**:
   - Used heading calculations between current and previous positions to detect drift and correct the course.

# Mechanical Aspects 

## **Boat Hulls**
- **Design Concepts**:
  - Hull dimensions were determined using formulas from [Catamaran Hull Design Formulas](https://www.catamaransite.com/reference/catamaran_hull_design_formulas/).
  - MATLAB was used to compile these formulas, ensuring the calculated dimensions achieved proper buoyancy and stability.
   ![Boat Hulls](Images\Hull1.png) ![Hull](Images\Hull2.png) ![Hull_2](Images\Hull3.png)
- **Fabrication Process**:
  1. 1-inch foam layers were glued together with wood glue.
  2. The glued foam blocks were CNC-milled into shape based on the validated dimensions.
  3. Final finishing included sanding, coating with fiberglass and epoxy for waterproofing, and spray-painting for durability and aesthetics.

## **Thrust System**
- **Design Goals**:
  - Ensure motors deliver adequate propulsion for navigating currents and waypoints.
  - Protect motors from debris (e.g., seaweed and branches) while maintaining efficiency.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - CAD files from a BlueROV thruster were modified to fit the brushless motor dimensions.
  - Caps were added to both ends of the motor to prevent debris intake, which has effectively minimized issues during testing.
  - Motors were secured to the hulls using custom 3D-printed mounts, reinforced with epoxy and super glue for stability.
   ![Thruster](Images\Thruster_1.png) ![Thruster](Images\Thruster_2.png)

## **Waterproofing**
- **Hull Waterproofing**:
  - The foam hulls were coated with fiberglass and epoxy for structural integrity and waterproofing.
  - Spray paint provided an additional layer of protection against water infiltration.
- **Electrical Housing Waterproofing**:
  - The platform housing electrical components was spackled, sanded, and painted to create a water-resistant enclosure.
  - The lid design included tight tolerances to block water splashes while remaining removable for maintenance and upgrades.

## **Electrical Housing Platform**
- **Design Features**:
  - Inspired by catamaran architecture, the housing is elevated and arched, protecting critical electronics from water exposure.
  - Front and rear openings were added to enable water flow for ESC cooling.
  - Additional holes allow direct connections between motors and ESCs, ensuring clean and efficient wiring.
  ![Platform](Images\Platform_1.png) 

## **Motor Selection**
- **Considered Options**:
  - Motors specifically designed for underwater applications were evaluated but rejected due to extended delivery times.
  - Brushless motors were selected for their high torque-to-speed ratio, critical for consistent thrust in aquatic environments.
- **Selection Rationale**:
  - The VGEBY1 brushless motors demonstrated sufficient torque and durability during external testing, such as their ability to handle high-stress scenarios like drone crashes.

## **ESC Coolers**
- **Design and Fabrication**:
  - The ESC coolers were modeled after PC cooling systems, leveraging the boat’s motion to pass water through cooling channels.
  - Aluminum stock was machined into radiator-like channels, which were mounted to the ESCs using thermal paste and glue.
- **Passive Cooling Operation**:
  - As the boat moves, water is channeled through tubing into the ESC cooler, dissipating heat without additional power requirements.

## **Subsystem Relationships**
The mechanical, electrical, and software components work together to achieve the boat's autonomous functionality:

1. **Motor Mounts and ESCs**:
   - Motors are securely mounted to the hulls using 3D-printed brackets that are reinforced with epoxy and super glue.
   - Each motor is powered by an ESC, which receives PWM signals from the Arduino to control speed and direction.

2. **Electrical Housing Platform**:
   - The housing protects electrical components like the Arduino and ESCs while allowing for connections to motors and sensors.
   - ESC coolers, mounted on the platform, rely on boat speed to pass water through aluminum channels for passive cooling.

3. **Boat Hulls and Waterproofing**:
   - The hulls support the motor mounts and electrical housing while ensuring buoyancy.
   - Fiberglass, epoxy, and spray paint provide waterproofing, maintaining structural integrity.

4. **Software Integration**:
   - The Arduino reads GPS data to calculate heading and target waypoints.
   - Software logic adjusts PWM signals sent to the ESCs, directing the motors to correct the boat's course.
   - Feedback from the GPS ensures that the boat continuously adjusts to stay on track.

## Reflection and Documentation

### **Lessons Learned**
- Dealing with broken hardware (compass) forced us to adapt navigation using GPS data only.
- Debugging overflow issues in the main loop ensured GPS reliability.
- ADD MORE LATER

### **Tradeoffs**
- Without a working compass, navigation logic relied on heading calculations derived from GPS coordinates.
- MORE!!!!!!!! LATER
